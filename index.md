The Linux command line interface is used to copy files, run programs, and perform many interactive functions, but it also supplies many of the features of more sophisticated general-purpose programming languages, such as flow control, variables, and subroutines. Making use of this expanded functionality allows the user to automate repetitive tasks, chain operations together in job submission scripts, and interact with a variety of command line tools. 

This online course will show how to create and run a script, detail the syntax and structure, and demonstrate how to use common text processing tools such as ‘sed’ and ‘awk’ to expand text processing functionality, with the overall goal of increasing productivity in a research environment by reducing the amount of time taken on regular housekeeping operations.
